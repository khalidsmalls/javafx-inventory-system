# javafx-inventory-system
my C482 performance assessment

this version has a little extra goodness added.
Inventory is a singleton instead of static.
A DependencyManager class has been added to abstract 
away the fxml loader logic and handle passing the required 
dependencies to the appropriate controllers.
A mysql database has been implemented for persistent data 
storage. CSS has been added and is currently a work in 
progress.
